    longDesc: `My mom had an idea for a website that houses 3 separate blogs. We wanted to use WordPress as the cms but most WordPress themes are designed around a singular blog. At its core, I created a custom WordPress theme, but I hardcoded a sizable portion of the site to add specific features the WordPress loop cannot easily supply. 
    \n
    My mom wanted her site to have a water-like flow. I built a landing page filled with curves, large images, and a color pallet stripped directly from a photo of the New England shoreline. The page is fully responsive, with the mobile version featuring an immensely different design than the desktop version, but still conveys the same information. 
    \n

    To achieve 3 blogs using one WordPress CMS, there is no publicly accessible global archive page, but rather 3 category pages mimicking archive pages. Every post is categorized and uses WordPress hooks to navigate only within the current category. You may notice some peculiar touches, such as a drop down image of a door in the desktop navigation menu. This image was hardcoded at the request of my mom. 
    \n

    Since the site’s launch at the end of January, I have continued to maintain and update the site at my mom’s request, adding features, like widget support, to pages when needed.
    \n

    I hope you enjoy browsing New England Mermaid. Maybe you’ll learn something new about the ocean along the way!`,
